# Network Anomaly Detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of network anomalies using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By leveraging the capabilities of GNNs, the model can effectively capture complex patterns and relationships in network data, identifying anomalous activities that deviate from the norm.

## Features

- **Graph Representation of Networks**: Networks are represented as graphs where nodes represent entities (e.g., devices, users) and edges represent relationships (e.g., connections, communications).
- **Anomaly Detection**: The model identifies anomalies in network traffic, communications, or behavior patterns using GNNs.
- **Scalable and Robust**: Designed to handle large-scale network data with high accuracy and efficiency.
- **Customizable and Extensible**: Easily extendable to various types of networks and anomaly detection scenarios.
